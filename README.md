# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Project Introduction
You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.

## Objective & Key Questions
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. The
stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?

○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

## Data & Tools Used
There were many datasets used for analysis of this project, which includes Customers, Orders, Products, and Department datasets. There were many different versions of each, which finalized into one clean and merged dataset. The primary coding tool used in this project was Python executed in Jupyter notebooks. The following tools/libraries were used throughout the duration of the project as well:

  - Pandas: For data analysis
  - Numpy: For numerical operations
  - OS: Interaction between operating system and Python, for file and directory operations
  - Matplotlib.pyplot: For plotting data values in graphical and data visualization formats
  - Seaborn: For more additional statistical data visualization
  - Scipy: For more advanced mathmatical and technical computing

## Folders
The makeup of this project is divided into the following folder structures:

- 01 Project Managment: Detailed project brief PDF
- 02 Data: Contains "Original Data" and "Prepared Data" subfolders for all portions of this project. Cleaned and merged CSV and Pickle files were used for analysis. *This data file is not included due to GitHub upload file size limitations*
- 03 Scripts: All Python coding scripts in Jupyter notebooks used for analysis and visualization
- 04 Analysis: Under "Visualizations" subfolder, there contains all the data visualizations used in this project
- 05 Sent to Client: The final report in Excel format
